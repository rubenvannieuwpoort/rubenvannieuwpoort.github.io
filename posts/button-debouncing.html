<article><h1>Button debouncing</h1>
<p>If you have any kind of digital system that reads the state of a mechanical button, you may run into the issue of “button bouncing”: When the user presses or releases the button, the system detects it as a very rapid succession of a press, release, press, … This can either be due to the button physically bouncing, or due to electrical noise. There is a standard solution called “button debouncing”. It is not super complicated, but not completely trivial either, so I consider it worthy of documenting here for future reference.</p>
<p>The idea is that we consider the state of the button as “unknown” (or “unchanged”, so equal to whatever it was before) until it is stable for a certain amount of time (meaning that the electrical input we read from the device has not changed in this time). I recommend to start with 50 milliseconds and adjust according to your needs.</p>
<p>With polling, we get something like:</p>
<pre><code>global time last_state_change_time = 0;
global duration required_noise_free_time = 50ms;
global state last_state = NOT_PRESSED, denoised_state = NOT_PRESSED;

(in some loop that gets executed very often):
	current_state = read_button_state(button)
	var time = now();
	if (current_state != last_state) {
		last_state_change_time = time;
		last_state = current_state;
	}
	else if (time &gt;= last_state_change_time + required_noise_free_time) {
		denoised_state = last_state;
	}
</code></pre>
<p>With interrupts, the solution is much cleaner:</p>
<pre><code>global duration required_noise_free_time = 50ms;
global state last_state = NOT_PRESSED, denoised_state = NOT_PRESSED;

on state change:
  last_state = current_state;
  reset(timer, required_noise_free_time);

when timer times out:
  denoised_state = last_state;
</code></pre>
